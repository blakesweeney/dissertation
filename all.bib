abstract = {WebFR3D is the on-line version of 'Find RNA 3D' (FR3D), a program for annotating atomic-resolution RNA 3D structure files and searching them efficiently to locate and compare RNA 3D structural motifs. WebFR3D provides on-line access to the central features of FR3D, including geometric and symbolic search modes, without need for installing programs or downloading and maintaining 3D structure data locally. In geometric search mode, WebFR3D finds all motifs similar to a user-specified query structure. In symbolic search mode, WebFR3D finds all sets of nucleotides making user-specified interactions. In both modes, users can specify sequence, sequence-continuity, base pairing, base-stacking and other constraints on nucleotides and their interactions. WebFR3D can be used to locate hairpin, internal or junction loops, list all base pairs or other interactions, or find instances of recurrent RNA 3D motifs (such as sarcin-ricin and kink-turn internal loops or T- and GNRA hairpin loops) in any PDB file or across a whole set of 3D structure files. The output page provides facilities for comparing the instances returned by the search by superposition of the 3D structures and the alignment of their sequences annotated with pairwise interactions. WebFR3D is available at http://rna.bgsu.edu/webfr3d.},

@article{Roll2016,
abstract = {Many non-coding RNAs have been identified and may function by forming 2D and 3D structures. RNA hairpin and internal loops are often represented as unstructured on secondary structure diagrams, but RNA 3D structures show that most such loops are structured by non-Watson-Crick basepairs and base stacking. Moreover, different RNA sequences can form the same RNA 3D motif. JAR3D finds possible 3D geometries for hairpin and internal loops by matching loop sequences to motif groups from the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, by exact sequence match when possible, and by probabilistic scoring and edit distance for novel sequences. The scoring gauges the ability of the sequences to form the same pattern of interactions observed in 3D structures of the motif. The JAR3D webserver at http://rna.bgsu.edu/jar3d/ takes one or many sequences of a single loop as input, or else one or many sequences of longer RNAs with multiple loops. Each sequence is scored against all current motif groups. The output shows the ten best-matching motif groups. Users can align input sequences to each of the motif groups found by JAR3D. JAR3D will be updated with every release of the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, and so its performance is expected to improve over time.},

abstract = {The R3D Align web server provides online access to 'RNA 3D Align' (R3D Align), a method for producing accurate nucleotide-level structural alignments of RNA 3D structures. The web server provides a streamlined and intuitive interface, input data validation and output that is more extensive and easier to read and interpret than related servers. The R3D Align web server offers a unique Gallery of Featured Alignments, providing immediate access to pre-computed alignments of large RNA 3D structures, including all ribosomal RNAs, as well as guidance on effective use of the server and interpretation of the output. By accessing the non-redundant lists of RNA 3D structures provided by the Bowling Green State University RNA group, R3D Align connects users to structure files in the same equivalence class and the best-modeled representative structure from each group.

abstract = {The RNA 3D Structure-to-Multiple Sequence Alignment Server (R3D-2-MSA) is a new web service that seamlessly links RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures to high-quality RNA multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from diverse biological sources. In this first release, R3D-2-MSA provides manual and programmatic access to curated, representative ribosomal RNA sequence alignments from bacterial, archaeal, eukaryal and organellar ribosomes, using nucleotide numbers from representative atomic-resolution 3D structures. A web-based front end is available for manual entry and an Application Program Interface for programmatic access. Users can specify up to five ranges of nucleotides and 50 nucleotide positions per range. The R3D-2-MSA server maps these ranges to the appropriate columns of the corresponding MSA and returns the contents of the columns, either for display in a web browser or in JSON format for subsequent programmatic use. The browser output page provides a 3D interactive display of the query, a full list of sequence variants with taxonomic information and a statistical summary of distinct sequence variants found. The output can be filtered and sorted in the browser. Previous user queries can be viewed at any time by resubmitting the output URL, which encodes the search and re-generates the results. The service is freely available with no login requirement at http://rna.bgsu.edu/r3d-2-msa.},

@phdthesis{Petrov2012,
abstract = {Many hairpin and internal RNA 3D motif structures are recurrent, occurring in various types of RNA molecules, not necessarily homologs. Although usually drawn as single-strand “loops” in RNA 2D diagrams, recurrent motifs share a common 3D structure, but can vary in sequence. It is essential to understand the sequence variability of RNA 3D motifs in order to advance the RNA 2D and 3D structure prediction and ncRNA discovery methods, to interpret mutations that affect ncRNAs, and to guide experimental functional studies. The dissertation is organized into two parts as follows. First, the development of a new online resource called RNA 3D Hub is described, which is intended to provide a useful resource for structure modeling and prediction. It houses non-redundant sets of RNA-containing 3D structures, RNA 3D motifs extracted from all RNA 3D structures, and the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, a representative collection of RNA 3D motifs. Unique and stable ids are assigned to all non-redundant equivalence classes of structure files, to all motifs, and to all motif instances. RNA 3D Hub is updated automatically on a regular schedule and is available at http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub. In the second part of the dissertation, the development of WebFR3D (http://rna.bgsu.edu/webfr3d), a new webserver for finding and aligning RNA 3D motifs, is described and its use in a biologically relevant context is then illustrated using two RNA 3D motifs. The first motif was predicted in Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd), and the prediction was supported by functional evidence. The second motif had previously been undescribed, although it is found in multiple 3D structures. RNA 3D Hub, RNA 3D Motif Atlas, and the bioinformatic techniques discussed in this dissertation lay the groundwork for further research into RNA 3D motif prediction starting from sequence and provide useful online resources for the scientific community worldwide.},
