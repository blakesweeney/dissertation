abstract = {The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme occurs in the genomic and antigenomic strands of the HDV RNA and within mammalian transcriptomes. Previous kinetic studies suggested that a wobble pair (G*U or A(+)*C) is preferred at the cleavage site; however, the reasons for this are unclear. We conducted sequence comparisons, which indicated that while G*U is the most prevalent combination at the cleavage site, G-C occurs to a significant extent in genomic HDV isolates, and G*U, G-C, and A-U pairs are present in mammalian ribozymes. We analyzed the folding of genomic HDV ribozymes by free energy minimization and found that variants with purine-pyrimidine combinations at the cleavage site are predicted to form native structures while pyrimidine-purine combinations misfold, consistent with earlier kinetic data and sequence comparisons. To test whether the cleavage site base pair contributes to catalysis, we characterized the pH and Mg(2+)-dependence of reaction kinetics of fast-folding genomic HDV ribozymes with cleavage site base pair purine-pyrimidine combinations: G*U, A-U, G-C, and A(+)*C. Rates for these native-folding ribozymes displayed highly similar pH and Mg(2+) concentration dependencies, with the exception of the A(+)*C ribozyme, which deviated at high pH. None of the four ribozymes underwent miscleavage. These observations support the A(+)*C ribozyme as being more active with a wobble pair at the cleavage site than with no base pair at all. Overall, the data support a model in which the cleavage site base pair provides a structural role in catalysis and does not need to be a wobble pair.},

abstract = {The four-base loops that cap many double-helical structures in rRNA (the so-called "tetra-loops") exhibit highly invariant to highly variable sequences depending upon their location in the molecule. However, in the vast majority of these cases the sequence of a tetra-loop is independent of its location and conforms to one of three general motifs, GNRA, UNCG, and (more rarely) CUUG. For the most frequently varying of the 16S rRNA tetra-loops, that at position 83 (Escherichia coli numbering), the three sequences CUUG, UUCG, and GCAA account for almost all examples encountered, and each of them has independently arisen at least a dozen times. The closing base pair of tetra-loop hairpins reflects the loop sequence, tending to be C.G for UUCG loops and G.C for CUUG loops.},

@article{Gutell1994,
abstract = {The 16S and 23S rRNA higher-order structures inferred from comparative analysis are now quite refined. The models presented here differ from their immediate predecessors only in minor detail. Thus, it is safe to assert that all of the standard secondary-structure elements in (prokaryotic) rRNAs have been identified, with approximately 90{\%} of the individual base pairs in each molecule having independent comparative support, and that at least some of the tertiary interactions have been revealed. It is interesting to compare the rRNAs in this respect with tRNA, whose higher-order structure is known in detail from its crystal structure (36) (Table 2). It can be seen that rRNAs have as great a fraction of their sequence in established secondary-structure elements as does tRNA. However, the fact that the former show a much lower fraction of identified tertiary interactions and a greater fraction of unpaired nucleotides than the latter implies that many of the rRNA tertiary interactions remain to be located. (Alternatively, the ribosome might involve protein-rRNA rather than intramolecular rRNA interactions to stabilize three-dimensional structure.) Experimental studies on rRNA are consistent to a first approximation with the structures proposed here, confirming the basic assumption of comparative analysis, i.e., that bases whose compositions strictly covary are physically interacting. In the exhaustive study of Moazed et al. (45) on protection of the bases in the small-subunit rRNA against chemical modification, the vast majority of bases inferred to pair by covariation are found to be protected from chemical modification, both in isolated small-subunit rRNA and in the 30S subunit. The majority of the tertiary interactions are reflected in the chemical protection data as well (45). On the other hand, many of the bases not shown as paired in Fig. 1 are accessible to chemical attack (45). However, in this case a sizeable fraction of them are also protected against chemical modification (in the isolated rRNA), which suggests that considerable higher-order structure remains to be found (although all of it may not involve base-base interactions and so may not be detectable by comparative analysis). The agreement between the higher-order structure of the small-subunit rRNA and protection against chemical modification is not perfect, however; some bases shown to covary canonically are accessible to chemical modification (45).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Base stacking is a major interaction shaping up and stabilizing nucleic acids. During the last decades, base stacking has been extensively studied by experimental and theoretical methods. Advanced quantum-chemical calculations clarified that base stacking is a common interaction, which in the first approximation can be described as combination of the three most basic contributions to molecular interactions, namely, electrostatic interaction, London dispersion attraction and short-range repulsion. There is not any specific $\pi$-$\pi$ energy term associated with the delocalized $\pi$ electrons of the aromatic rings that cannot be described by the mentioned contributions. The base stacking can be rather reasonably approximated by simple molecular simulation methods based on well-calibrated common force fields although the force fields do not include nonadditivity of stacking, anisotropy of dispersion interactions, and some other effects. However, description of stacking association in condensed phase and understanding of the stacking role in biomolecules remain a difficult problem, as the net base stacking forces always act in a complex and context-specific environment. Moreover, the stacking forces are balanced with many other energy contributions. Differences in definition of stacking in experimental and theoretical studies are explained. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 99: 978-988, 2013.},

The challenge is to link these different approaches in a theoretical framework that relates the energetics of ion-RNA interactions to the spatial distribution of ions. This review distinguishes three different kinds of ion environments that differ in the extent of direct ion-RNA contacts and the degree to which the ion hydration is perturbed, and summarizes the current understanding of the way each environment relates to the overall energetics of RNA folding.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli 23 S and 5 S rRNA molecules have been fitted helix by helix to a cryo-electron microscopic (EM) reconstruction of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, using an unfiltered version of the recently published 50 S reconstruction at 7.5 A resolution. At this resolution, the EM density shows a well-defined network of fine structural elements, in which the major and minor grooves of the rRNA helices can be discerned at many locations. The 3D folding of the rRNA molecules within this EM density is constrained by their well-established secondary structures, and further constraints are provided by intra and inter-rRNA crosslinking data, as well as by tertiary interactions and pseudoknots. RNA-protein cross-link and foot-print sites on the 23 S and 5 S rRNA were used to position the rRNA elements concerned in relation to the known arrangement of the ribosomal proteins as determined by immuno-electron microscopy. The published X-ray or NMR structures of seven 50 S ribosomal proteins or RNA-protein complexes were incorporated into the EM density. The 3D locations of cross-link and foot-print sites to the 23 S rRNA from tRNA bound to the ribosomal A, P or E sites were correlated with the positions of the tRNA molecules directly observed in earlier reconstructions of the 70 S ribosome at 13 A or 20 A. Similarly, the positions of cross-link sites within the peptidyl transferase ring of the 23 S rRNA from the aminoacyl residue of tRNA were correlated with the locations of the CCA ends of the A and P site tRNA. Sites on the 23 S rRNA that are cross-linked to the N termini of peptides of different lengths were all found to lie within or close to the internal tunnel connecting the peptidyl transferase region with the presumed peptide exit site on the solvent side of the 50 S subunit. The post-transcriptionally modified bases in the 23 S rRNA form a cluster close to the peptidyl transferase area. The minimum conserved core elements of the secondary structure of the 23 S rRNA form a compact block within the 3D structure and, conversely, the points corresponding to the locations of expansion segments in 28 S rRNA all lie on the outside of the structure.},

The probes include 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT; to probe U at N-3 and G at N-1), diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC; to probe A at N-7), dimethyl sulfate (DMS; to probe A at N-1, and C at N-3), kethoxal (to probe G at N-1 and N-2), hydroxyl radicals generated by free Fe(II)-EDTA (to probe the backbone ribose groups) and Pb(II). The sites of reaction were identified by primer extension of the probed RNA. Association of the subunits protects the bases of 11 nucleotides and the ribose groups of over 90 nucleotides of 16S rRNA. The nucleotides protected from the base-specific probes are often adjacent to one another and surrounded by sugar-phosphate backbone protections; thus, the results obtained with the different probes confirmed each other. Most of the protected nucleotides occur in five extended-stem-loop structures around positions 250, 700, 790, 900, and 1408-1495. These regions are located in the platform and bottom of the subunit in the general vicinity of inter-subunit bridges that are visible in reconstructed electron micrographs. Our results provide an extensive map of the nucleotides in 16S rRNA that are likely to be involved in subunit-subunit interactions.},

The cytotoxins alpha-sarcin and ricin both inactivate ribosomes by cleaving a single bond in that loop. Once it has been attacked, ribosomes no longer interact with elongation factors properly, and translation stops. We have determined the conformation of the sarcin/ricin loop by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy using E73, a 29-nucleotide RNA that has the sarcin/ricin loop sequence and that is sensitive to both toxins in vitro. The sarcin/ricin loop has a compact structure that contains several purine.purine base pairs, a GAGA tetraloop, and a bulged guanosine adjacent to a reverse Hoogsteen A.U pair. It is stabilized by an unusual set of cross-strand base-stacking interactions and imino proton to phosphate oxygen hydrogen bonds. In addition to having interesting structural features, this model explains many of the biochemical observations made about the loop's structure and its reactivity with cytotoxins, and it sheds light on the loop's interactions with elongation factors.},

Determining their structural configuration is important for predicting RNA 3D structure. We introduce a computational method to predict, at the secondary structure level, the coaxial helical stacking arrangement in junctions, as well as classify the junction topology. Our approach uses a data mining approach known as random forests, which relies on a set of decision trees trained using length, sequence and other variables specified for any given junction. The resulting protocol predicts coaxial stacking within three- and four-way junctions with an accuracy of 81{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively; the accuracy increases to 83{\%} and 87{\%}, respectively, when knowledge from the junction family type is included. Coaxial stacking predictions for the five to ten-way junctions are less accurate (60{\%}) due to sparse data available for training. Additionally, our application predicts the junction family with an accuracy of 85{\%} for three-way junctions and 74{\%} for four-way junctions. Comparisons with other methods, as well applications to unsolved RNAs, are also presented.

Accurately assigning nucleotides to helices compels a revision of the 23S rRNA 2° structure. Unlike the traditional 2° structure, the revised 2° structure of the 23S rRNA shows architectural similarity with the 16S rRNA. The revised 2° structure also reveals a clear relationship with the 3D structure and is generalizable to rRNAs of other species from all three domains of life. The 2° structure revision required us to reconsider the domain architecture. We partitioned the 23S rRNA into domains through analysis of molecular interactions, calculations of 2D folding propensities and compactness. The best domain model for the 23S rRNA contains seven domains, not six as previously ascribed. Domain 0 forms the core of the 23S rRNA, to which the other six domains are rooted.

abstract = {Despite the importance of local structural detail to a mechanistic understanding of RNA catalysis and binding functions, RNA backbone conformation has been quite recalcitrant to analysis. There are too many variable torsion angles per residue, and their raw empirical distributions are poorly clustered. This study applies quality-filtering techniques (using resolution, crystallographic B factor, and all-atom steric clashes) to the backbone torsion angle distributions from an 8,636-residue RNA database. With noise levels greatly reduced, clear signal appears for the underlying angle preferences. Half-residue torsion angle distributions for alpha-beta-gamma and for delta-epsilon-zeta are plotted and contoured in 3D; each shows about a dozen distinct peaks, which can then be combined in pairs to define complete RNA backbone conformers. Traditional nucleic acid residues are defined from phosphate to phosphate, but here we use a base-to-base (or sugar-to-sugar) division into "suites" to parse the RNA backbone repeats, both because most backbone steric clashes are within suites and because the relationship of successive bases is both reliably determined and conformationally important. A suite conformer has seven variables, with sugar pucker specified at both ends. Potential suite conformers were omitted if not represented by at least a small cluster of convincing data points after application of quality filters. The final result is a small library of 42 RNA backbone conformers, which should provide valid conformations for nearly all RNA backbone encountered in experimental structures.},

abstract = {RNA molecules are stabilized by a wide range of noncanonical interactions that are not present in DNA. Among them, the recently classified base-phosphate (BPh) interactions belong to the most important ones. Twelve percent of nucleotides in the ribosomal crystal structures are involved in BPh interactions. BPh interactions are highly conserved and provide major constraints on RNA sequence evolution. Here we provide assessment of the energetics of BPh interactions using MP2 computations extrapolated to the complete basis set of atomic orbitals and corrected for higher-order electron correlation effects. The reference computations are compared with DFT-D and DFT-D3 approaches, the SAPT method, and the molecular mechanics force field. The computations, besides providing the basic benchmark for the BPh interactions, allow some refinements of the original classification, including identification of some potential doubly bonded BPh patterns. The reference computations are followed by analysis of some larger RNA fragments that consider the context of the BPh interactions. The computations demonstrate the complexity of interaction patterns utilizing the BPh interactions in real RNA structures. The BPh interactions are often involved in intricate interaction networks. We studied BPh interactions of protonated adenine that can contribute to catalysis of hairpin ribozyme, the key BPh interaction in the S-turn motif of the sarcin-ricin loop, which may predetermine the S-turn topology and complex BPh patterns from the glmS riboswitch. Finally, the structural stability of BPh interactions in explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations is assessed. The simulations well preserve key BPh interactions and allow dissection of structurally/functionally important water-meditated BPh bridges, which could not be considered in earlier bioinformatics classification of BPh interactions.},

abstract = {Using the atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with two substrate analogs, we establish that the ribosome is a ribozyme and address the catalytic properties of its all-RNA active site. Both substrate analogs are contacted exclusively by conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residues from domain V of 23S rRNA; there are no protein side-chain atoms closer than about 18 angstroms to the peptide bond being synthesized. The mechanism of peptide bond synthesis appears to re- semble the reverse of the acylation step in serine proteases, with the base of A2486 (A2451 in Escherichia coli) playing the same general base role as his- tidine-57 in chymotrypsin. The unusual pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) required for A2486 to perform this function may derive in part from its hydrogen bonding to G2482 (G2447 in E. coli), which also interacts with a buried phosphate that could stabilize unusual tautomers of these two bases. The polypeptide exit tunnel is largely formed by RNA but has significant contri- butions from proteins L4, L22, and L39e, and its exit is encircled by proteins L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e},

abstract = {RNA motifs can be defined broadly as recurrent structural elements containing multiple intramolecular RNA-RNA interactions, as observed in atomic-resolution RNA structures. They constitute the modular building blocks of RNA architecture, which is organized hierarchically. Recent work has focused on analyzing RNA backbone conformations to identify, define and search for new instances of recurrent motifs in X-ray structures. One current view asserts that recurrent RNA strand segments with characteristic backbone configurations qualify as independent motifs. Other considerations indicate that, to characterize modular motifs, one must take into account the larger structural context of such strand segments. This follows the biologically relevant motivation, which is to identify RNA structural characteristics that are subject to sequence constraints and that thus relate RNA architectures to sequences.},

abstract = {RNA molecules exhibit complex structures in which a large fraction of the bases engage in non-Watson-Crick base pairing, forming motifs that mediate long-range RNA-RNA interactions and create binding sites for proteins and small molecule ligands. The rapidly growing number of three-dimensional RNA structures at atomic resolution requires that databases contain the annotation of such base pairs. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature was proposed recently in which RNA base pairs were classified by the base edges participating in the interaction (Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen/CH or sugar edge) and the orientation of the glycosidic bonds relative to the hydrogen bonds (cis or trans). Twelve basic geometric families were identified and all 12 have been observed in crystal structures. For each base pairing family, we present here the 4 x 4 'isostericity matrices' summarizing the geometric relationships between the 16 pairwise combinations of the four standard bases, A, C, G and U. Whenever available, a representative example of each observed base pair from X-ray crystal structures (3.0 A resolution or better) is provided or, otherwise, theoretically plausible models. This format makes apparent the recurrent geometric patterns that are observed and helps identify isosteric pairs that co-vary or interchange in sequences of homologous molecules while maintaining conserved three-dimensional motifs.},

abstract = {Secondary structure plays critical roles in nucleic acid function. Mismatches in DNA can lead to mutation and disease, and some mismatches involve a protonated base. Among protonated mismatches, A(+).C wobble pairs form near physiological pH and have relatively minor effects on helix geometry, making them especially important in biology. Herein, we investigate effects of helix position, temperature, and ionic strength on pK(a) shifting in A(+).C wobble pairs in DNA. We observe that pK(a) shifting is favored by internal A(+).C wobbles, which have low cooperativities of folding and make large contributions to stability, and disfavored by external A(+).C wobbles, which have high folding cooperativities but make small contributions to stability. An inverse relationship between pK(a) shifting and temperature is also found, which supports a model in which protonation is enthalpically favored overall and entropically correlated with cooperativity of folding. We also observe greater pK(a) shifts as the ionic strength decreases, consistent with anticooperativity between proton binding and counterion-condensed monovalent cation. Under the most favorable temperature and ionic strength conditions tested, a pK(a) of 8.0 is observed for the A(+).C wobble pair, which represents an especially large shift ( approximately 4.5 pK(a) units) from the unperturbed pK(a) value of adenosine. This study suggests that protonated A(+).C wobble pairs exist in DNA under biologically relevant conditions, where they can drive conformational changes and affect replication and transcription fidelity.},

abstract = {Biomedical Ontologies integrate diverse biomedical data and enable intelligent data-mining and help translate basic research into useful clinical knowledge. We present the RNA Ontology (RNAO), an ontology for integrating diverse RNA data, including RNA sequences and sequence alignments, three-dimensional structures, and biochemical and functional data. For example, individual atomic resolution RNA structures have broader significance as representatives of classes of homologous molecules, which can differ significantly in sequence while sharing core structural features and common roles or functions. Thus, structural data gain value by being linked to homologous sequences in genomic data and databases of sequence alignments. Likewise, the value of genomic data is enhanced by annotation of shared structural features, especially when these can be linked to specific functions. Moreover, the significance of biochemical, functional and mutational analyses of RNA molecules are most fully understood when linked to molecular structures and phylogenies. To achieve these goals, RNAO provides logically rigorous definitions of the components of RNA primary, secondary and tertiary structure and the relations between these entities. RNAO is being developed to comply with the developing standards of the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Consortium. The RNAO can be accessed at http://code.google.com/p/rnao/.},

abstract = {Structured RNA molecules form complex 3D architectures stabilized by multiple interactions involving the nucleotide base, sugar and phosphate moieties. A significant percentage of the bases in structured RNA molecules in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) hydrogen-bond with phosphates of other nucleotides. By extracting and superimposing base-phosphate (BPh) interactions from a reduced-redundancy subset of 3D structures from the PDB, we identified recurrent phosphate-binding sites on the RNA bases. Quantum chemical calculations were carried out on model systems representing each BPh interaction. The calculations show that the centers of each cluster obtained from the structure superpositions correspond to energy minima on the potential energy hypersurface. The calculations also show that the most stable phosphate-binding sites occur on the Watson-Crick edge of guanine and the Hoogsteen edge of cytosine. We modified the 'Find RNA 3D' (FR3D) software suite to automatically find and classify BPh interactions. Comparison of the 3D structures of the 16S and 23S rRNAs of Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus revealed that most BPh interactions are phylogenetically conserved and they occur primarily in hairpin, internal or junction loops or as part of tertiary interactions. Bases that form BPh interactions, which are conserved in the rRNA 3D structures are also conserved in homologous rRNA sequence alignments.},

As many as 40{\%} of the nucleotides of an RNA molecule can belong to these structural elements, which are distinct from the regular double helical regions formed by contiguous AU, GC, and GU Watson-Crick basepairs. With the large number of atomic- or near atomic-resolution 3D structures appearing in a steady stream in the PDB/NDB structure databases, the automated identification, extraction, comparison, clustering and visualization of these structural elements presents an opportunity to enhance RNA science. Three broad applications are: (1) identification of modular, autonomous structural units for RNA nanotechnology, nanobiology and synthetic biology applications; (2) bioinformatic analysis to improve RNA 3D structure prediction from sequence; and (3) creation of searchable databases for exploring the binding specificities, structural flexibility, and dynamics of these RNA elements. In this contribution, we review methods developed for computational extraction of hairpin and internal loop motifs from a non-redundant set of high-quality RNA 3D structures. We provide a statistical summary of the extracted hairpin and internal loop motifs in the most recent version of the RNA 3D Motif Atlas. We also explore the reliability and accuracy of the extraction process by examining its performance in clustering recurrent motifs from homologous ribosomal RNA (rRNA) structures. We conclude with a summary of remaining challenges, especially with regard to extraction of multi-helix junction motifs.},

Non-Watson-Crick base pairs also play crucial roles in tertiary contacts in structured RNA molecules. We previously classified RNA base pairs geometrically so as to group together those base pairs that are structurally similar (isosteric) and therefore able to substitute for each other by mutation without disrupting the 3D structure. Here, we introduce a quantitative measure of base pair isostericity, the IsoDiscrepancy Index (IDI), to more accurately determine which base pair substitutions can potentially occur in conserved motifs. We extract and classify base pairs from a reduced-redundancy set of RNA 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and calculate centroids (exemplars) for each base combination and geometric base pair type (family). We use the exemplars and IDI values to update our online Basepair Catalog and the Isostericity Matrices (IM) for each base pair family. From the database of base pairs observed in 3D structures we derive base pair occurrence frequencies for each of the 12 geometric base pair families. In order to improve the statistics from the 3D structures, we also derive base pair occurrence frequencies from rRNA sequence alignments.},

abstract = {Structured RNA molecules resemble proteins in the hierarchical organization of their global structures, folding and broad range of functions. Structured RNAs are composed of recurrent modular motifs that play specific functional roles. Some motifs direct the folding of the RNA or stabilize the folded structure through tertiary interactions. Others bind ligands or proteins or catalyze chemical reactions. Therefore, it is desirable, starting from the RNA sequence, to be able to predict the locations of recurrent motifs in RNA molecules. Conversely, the potential occurrence of one or more known 3D RNA motifs may indicate that a genomic sequence codes for a structured RNA molecule. To identify known RNA structural motifs in new RNA sequences, precise structure-based definitions are needed that specify the core nucleotides of each motif and their conserved interactions. By comparing instances of each recurrent motif and applying base pair isosteriCity relations, one can identify neutral mutations that preserve its structure and function in the contexts in which it occurs.},

abstract = {Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons crystallize in four basic structure types which may be clearly differen- tiated by energetic and geometrical criteria. The major motifs in these four prototypes are the stack, or layer, and the glide, or herringbone. A study of 32 representative hydrocarbons shows that the adoption of one or the other structure type depends on the relative importance of C{\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}C and C{\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}H interactions and therefore on the number and positioning of C and H atoms in the molecule. Consequently, it is possible to consider part of the molecular free surface as 'stack promoting' and the rest as 'glide promoting'. Individual C and H atoms in a molecule may be assigned stack and glide factors based only on their atomic connec- tivity. Using these factors, a predictive mapping from molecular to crystal structure is attempted. Based as they are on molecular shape, the packing criteria proposed here provide a simple classification scheme and, in some cases, may be used to predict the crystal structures of other planar aromatic hydrocarbons.},

abstract = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge, hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic and chemical probing data indicate that a modular RNA motif, common to loop E of eucaryotic 5 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop of 23 S rRNA, organizes the structure of multi-helix loops in 16 S and 23 S ribosomal RNAs. The motif occurs in the 3' domain of 16 S rRNA at positions 1345-1350/1372-1376 (Escherichia coli numbering), within the three-way junction loop, which binds ribosomal protein S7, and which contains nucleotides that help to form the binding site for P-site tRNA in the ribosome. The motif also helps to structure a three-way junction within domain I of 23 S, which contains many universally conserved bases and which lies close in the primary and secondary structure to the binding site of r-protein L24. Several other highly conserved hairpin, internal, and multi-helix loops in 16 S and 23 S rRNA contain the motif, including the core junction loop of 23 S and helix 27 in the core of 16 S rRNA. Sequence conservation and range of variation in bacteria, archaea, and eucaryotes as well as chemical probing and cross-linking data, provide support for the recurrent and autonomous existence of the motif in ribosomal RNAs. Besides its presence in the hairpin ribozyme, the loop E motif is also apparent in helix P10 of bacterial RNase P, in domain P7 of one sub-group of group I introns, and in domain 3 of one subgroup of group II introns.},

abstract = {The self-assembly of RNA structure depends on the interactions of counterions with the RNA and with each other. Comparison of various polyamines showed that the tertiary structure of the Tetrahymena ribozyme is more stable when the counterions are small and highly charged. By monitoring the folding kinetics of the ribozyme as a function of polyamine concentration, we now find that the charge density of the counterions determines the positions of the folding transition states. The transition state ensemble (TSE) between U and N moves away from the native state as the counterion valence and charge density increase, as predicted by the Hammond postulate. The TSE is broader and less structured when the RNA is refolded in polyamines rather than Mg2+. That the charge density of the counterions determines the plasticity of the TSE demonstrates the importance of interactions among condensed counterions for the self-assembly of RNA structures. We propose that the major barrier to RNA folding is dominated by entropy changes when counterion charge density is low and enthalpy differences when it is high. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {New methods are described for finding recurrent three-dimensional (3D) motifs in RNA atomic-resolution structures. Recurrent RNA 3D motifs are sets of RNA nucleotides with similar spatial arrangements. They can be local or composite. Local motifs comprise nucleotides that occur in the same hairpin or internal loop. Composite motifs comprise nucleotides belonging to three or more different RNA strand segments or molecules. We use a base-centered approach to construct efficient, yet exhaustive search procedures using geometric, symbolic, or mixed representations of RNA structure that we implement in a suite of MATLAB programs, "Find RNA 3D" (FR3D). The first modules of FR3D preprocess structure files to classify base-pair and -stacking interactions. Each base is represented geometrically by the position of its glycosidic nitrogen in 3D space and by the rotation matrix that describes its orientation with respect to a common frame. Base-pairing and base-stacking interactions are calculated from the base geometries and are represented symbolically according to the Leontis/Westhof basepairing classification, extended to include base-stacking. These data are stored and used to organize motif searches. For geometric searches, the user supplies the 3D structure of a query motif which FR3D uses to find and score geometrically similar candidate motifs, without regard to the sequential position of their nucleotides in the RNA chain or the identity of their bases. To score and rank candidate motifs, FR3D calculates a geometric discrepancy by rigidly rotating candidates to align optimally with the query motif and then comparing the relative orientations of the corresponding bases in the query and candidate motifs. Given the growing size of the RNA structure database, it is impossible to explicitly compute the discrepancy for all conceivable candidate motifs, even for motifs with less than ten nucleotides. The screening algorithm that we describe finds all candidate motifs whose geometric discrepancy with respect to the query motif falls below a user-specified cutoff discrepancy. This technique can be applied to RMSD searches. Candidate motifs identified geometrically may be further screened symbolically to identify those that contain particular basepair types or base-stacking arrangements or that conform to sequence continuity or nucleotide identity constraints. Purely symbolic searches for motifs containing user-defined sequence, continuity and interaction constraints have also been implemented. We demonstrate that FR3D finds all occurrences, both local and composite and with nucleotide substitutions, of sarcin/ricin and kink-turn motifs in the 23S and 5S ribosomal RNA 3D structures of the H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit and assigns the lowest discrepancy scores to bona fide examples of these motifs. The search algorithms have been optimized for speed to allow users to search the non-redundant RNA 3D structure database on a personal computer in a matter of minutes.},

abstract = {A new computer program to annotate DNA and RNA three-dimensional structures, MC-Annotate, is introduced. The goals of annotation are to efficiently extract and manipulate structural information, to simplify further structural analyses and searches, and to objectively represent structural knowledge. The input of MC-Annotate is a PDB formatted DNA or RNA three-dimensional structure. The output of MC-Annotate is composed of a structural graph that contains the annotations, and a series of HTML documents, one for each nucleotide conformation and base-base interaction present in the input structure. The atomic coordinates of all nucleotides and the homogeneous transformation matrices of all base-base interactions are stored in the structural graph. Symbolic classifications of nucleotide conformations, using sugar puckering modes and nitrogen base orientations around the glycosyl bond, and base-base interactions, using stacking and hydrogen bonding information, are introduced. Peculiarity factors of nucleotide conformations and base-base interactions are defined to indicate their marginalities with all other examples. The peculiarity factors allow us to identify irregular regions and possible stereochemical errors in 3-D structures without interactive visualization. The annotations attached to each nucleotide conformation include its class, its torsion angles, a distribution of the root-mean-square deviations with examples of the same class, the list of examples of the same class, and its peculiarity value. The annotations attached to each base-base interaction include its class, a distribution of distances with examples of the same class, the list of examples of the same class, and its peculiarity value. The distance between two homogeneous transformation matrices is evaluated using a new metric that distinguishes between the rotation and the translation of a transformation matrix in the context of nitrogen bases. MC-Annotate was used to build databases of nucleotide conformations and base-base interactions. It was applied to the ribosomal RNA fragment that binds to protein L11, which annotations revealed peculiar nucleotide conformations and base-base interactions in the regions where the RNA contacts the protein. The question of whether the current database of RNA three-dimensional structures is complete is addressed.},

We searched representative atomic-resolution RNA 3D structures and found instances of 68 of the 108 predicted base triple families. Model building suggests that some of the remaining 40 families may be unlikely to form for steric reasons. We developed an on-line resource that provides exemplars of all base triples observed in the structure database and models for unobserved, predicted triples, grouped by triple family, as well as by three-base combination (http://rna.bgsu.edu/Triples). The classification helps to identify recurrent triple motifs that can substitute for each other while conserving RNA 3D structure, with applications in RNA 3D structure prediction and analysis of RNA sequence evolution.},

abstract = {A consensus classification and nomenclature are defined for RNA backbone structure using all of the backbone torsion angles. By a consensus of several independent analysis methods, 46 discrete conformers are identified as suitably clustered in a quality-filtered, multidimensional dihedral angle distribution. Most of these conformers represent identifiable features or roles within RNA structures. The conformers are given two-character names that reflect the seven-angle delta epsilon zeta alpha beta gamma delta combinations empirically found favorable for the sugar-to-sugar "suite" unit within which the angle correlations are strongest (e.g., 1a for A-form, 5z for the start of S-motifs). Since the half-nucleotides are specified by a number for delta epsilon zeta and a lowercase letter for alpha beta gamma delta, this modular system can also be parsed to describe traditional nucleotide units (e.g., a1) or the dinucleotides (e.g., a1a1) that are especially useful at the level of crystallographic map fitting. This nomenclature can also be written as a string with two-character suite names between the uppercase letters of the base sequence (N1aG1gN1aR1aA1cN1a for a GNRA tetraloop), facilitating bioinformatic comparisons. Cluster means, standard deviations, coordinates, and examples are made available, as well as the Suitename software that assigns suite conformer names and conformer match quality (suiteness) from atomic coordinates. The RNA Ontology Consortium will combine this new backbone system with others that define base pairs, base-stacking, and hydrogen-bond relationships to provide a full description of RNA structural motifs.},

State-of-the-art methods for detecting coevolving sites, however, while reaching high levels of specificity and sensitivity for Watson-Crick (WC) pairs of the helices defining the secondary structure, only scarcely reveal tertiary interactions occurring at the level of the 3D structure. In order to understand the relative failure of coevolutionary methods to detect such interactions, we analyze 2,682 interacting sites derived from high-resolution structures, which include a comprehensive data set of rRNA sequences from Archaea and Bacteria. We report a striking difference in the amount of coevolution between WC and non-WC pairs. In order to understand this pattern, we derive fitness landscapes from the geometry of base pairing interactions and construct neutral networks of substitutions for each type of interaction. These networks show that coevolution is a property of WC pairs because, unlike non-WC pairs, their landscapes exhibit fitness valleys, a single mutation in a WC pair resulting in a fitness drop. Second, we used the inferred neutral networks to estimate the level of constraint acting on each type of base pair and show that it correlates negatively with the observed rate of substitutions for all non-WC pairs. WC pairs appear as outliers, fixing more substitutions than expected according to their level of constraint. We here propose that the rate of substitution in WC pairs is due to coevolution resulting from constraints acting at intermediate levels of organization, namely the one of the helical stem with its forming WC pairs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report a significant excess of intrahelical, inter-WC pairs coevolution compared with interhelices pairs. Altogether, these results show that detailed biochemical knowledge is required and has to be incorporated into evolutionary reasoning in order to understand the fine patterns of variation at the molecular level. They also demonstrate that coevolutionary analysis provides almost exclusively 2D information and only little 3D signal.},

abstract = {The occurrences of two recurrent motifs in ribosomal RNA sequences, the Kink-turn and the C-loop, are examined in crystal structures and systematically compared with sequence alignments of rRNAs from the three kingdoms of life in order to identify the range of the structural and sequence variations. Isostericity Matrices are used to analyze structurally the sequence variations of the characteristic non-Watson-Crick base pairs for each motif. We show that Isostericity Matrices for non-Watson-Crick base pairs provide important tools for deriving the sequence signatures of recurrent motifs, for scoring and refining sequence alignments, and for determining whether motifs are conserved throughout evolution. The systematic use of Isostericity Matrices identifies the positions of the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides relative to the structurally characterized examples of motifs and, most importantly, specifies whether these changes result in new motifs. Thus, comparative analysis coupled with Isostericity Matrices allows one to produce and refine structural sequence alignments. The analysis, based on both sequence and structure, permits therefore the evaluation of the conservation of motifs across phylogeny and the derivation of rules of equivalence between structural motifs. The conservations observed in Isostericity Matrices form a predictive basis for identifying motifs in sequences.},

abstract = {The structure of a 29-nucleotide RNA containing the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) of rat 28 S rRNA has been determined at 2.1 A resolution. Recognition of the SRL by elongation factors and by the ribotoxins, sarcin and ricin, requires a nearly universal dodecamer sequence that folds into a G-bulged cross-strand A stack and a GAGA tetraloop. The juxtaposition of these two motifs forms a distorted hairpin structure that allows direct recognition of bases in both grooves as well as recognition of nonhelical backbone geometry and two 5'-unstacked purines. Comparisons with other RNA crystal structures establish the cross-strand A stack and the GNRA tetraloop as defined and modular RNA structural elements. The conserved region at the top is connected to the base of the domain by a region presumed to be flexible because of the sparsity of stabilizing contacts. Although the conformation of the SRL RNA previously determined by NMR spectroscopy is similar to the structure determined by x-ray crystallography, significant differences are observed in the "flexible" region and to a lesser extent in the G-bulged cross-strand A stack.},

abstract = {Three programs have been developed to aid in the classification and visualization of RNA structure. BPViewer provides a web interface for displaying three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of individual base pairs or base pair collections. A web server, RNAview, automatically identifies and classifies the types of base pairs that are formed in nucleic acid structures by various combinations of the three edges, Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen and the Sugar edge. RNAView produces two-dimensional (2D) diagrams of secondary and tertiary structure in either Postscript, VRML or RNAML formats. The application RNAMLview can be used to rearrange various parts of the RNAView 2D diagram to generate a standard representation (like the cloverleaf structure of tRNAs) or any layout desired by the user. A 2D diagram can be rapidly reformatted using RNAMLview since all the parts of RNA (like helices and single strands) are dynamically linked while moving the selected parts. With the base pair annotation and the 2D graphic display, RNA motifs are rapidly identified and classified. A survey has been carried out for 41 unique structures selected from the NDB database. The statistics for the occurrence of each edge and of each of the 12 bp families are given for the combinations of the four bases: A, G, U and C. The program also allows for visualization of the base pair interactions by using a symbolic convention previously proposed for base pairs. The web servers for BPViewer and RNAview are available at http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/services/. The application RNAMLview can also be downloaded from this site. The 2D diagrams produced by RNAview are available for RNA structures in the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) at http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/atlas/.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive structural, evolutionary and molecular dynamics (MD) study of the G/U wobble basepairs in the ribosome based on high-resolution crystal structures, including the recent Escherichia coli structure. These basepairs are classified according to their tertiary interactions, and sequence conservation at their positions is determined. G/U basepairs participating in tertiary interactions are more conserved than those lacking any interactions. Specific interactions occurring in the G/U shallow groove pocket--like packing interactions (P-interactions) and some phosphate backbone interactions (phosphate-in-pocket interactions)--lead to higher G/U conservation than others. Two salient cases of unique phylogenetic compensation are discovered. First, a P-interaction is conserved through a series of compensatory mutations involving all four participating nucleotides to preserve or restore the G/U in the optimal orientation. Second, a G/U basepair forming a P-interaction and another one forming a phosphate-in-pocket interaction are replaced by GNRA loops that maintain similar tertiary contacts. MD simulations were carried out on eight P-interactions. The specific GU/CG signature of this interaction observed in structure and sequence analysis was rationalized, and can now be used for improving sequence alignments.},

RNA 3D motifs are structurally diverse and play important architectural and molecular recognition roles. Predicting their 3D structures is a crucial step in solving the RNA structure prediction problem. To set the context, we first review the characteristics of structured RNA molecules, including the nature of the RNA polymer backbone, the properties of the nucleotide subunits, and the different ways nucleotides interact with each other to structure 3D motifs. Then we discuss how to define 3D motifs to enable automated search procedures in RNA 3D structures. We review programs that identify and extract 3D motifs from structures and databases created to annotate, compare, and store them. Finally, we provide examples of 3D motifs that constitute exceptions to the currently implemented definitions and discuss ways that automatic motif searching and classification in recurrent families can be improved.},

abstract = {The commonly used validation metrics for the local agreement of a structure model with the observed electron density, namely the real-space R (RSR) and the real-space correlation coefficient (RSCC), are reviewed. It is argued that the primary goal of all validation techniques is to verify the accuracy of the model, since precision is an inherent property of the crystal and the data. It is demonstrated that the principal weakness of both of the above metrics is their inability to distinguish the accuracy of the model from its precision. Furthermore, neither of these metrics in their usual implementation indicate the statistical significance of the result. The statistical properties of electron-density maps are reviewed and an improved alternative likelihood-based metric is suggested. This leads naturally to a $\chi$(2) significance test of the difference density using the real-space difference density Z score (RSZD). This is a metric purely of the local model accuracy, as required for effective model validation and structure optimization by practising crystallographers prior to submission of a structure model to the PDB. A new real-space observed density Z score (RSZO) is also proposed; this is a metric purely of the model precision, as a substitute for other precision metrics such as the B factor.},

abstract = {The along-groove packing motif is a quasi-reciprocal arrangement of two RNA double helices in which a backbone of each helix is closely packed within the minor groove of the other helix. At the center of the inter-helix contact, a GU base pair in one helix packs against a Watson-Crick base pair in the other helix. Here, based on in vivo selection from a combinatorial gene library of 16 S rRNA and on functional characterization of the selected clones, we demonstrate that the normal ribosome performance requires that helices 3 and 12 be closely packed. In some clones the Watson-Crick and GU base pairs exchange in their positions between the two helices, which affects neither the quality of the helix packing, nor the ribosome function. On the other hand, perturbations in the close packing usually lead to a substantial drop in the ribosome activity. The functionality of the clones containing such perturbations may depend on the presence of particular elements in the vicinity of the area of contact between helices 3 and 12. Such cases do not exist in natural 16 S rRNA, and their selection enriches our knowledge of the constraints imposed on the structure of ribosomal RNA in functional ribosomes.},

The key component of this T-loop motif is a UA trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen base pair stacked on a Watson-Crick pair on one side. This motif is stabilized by several noncanonical hydrogen bonds, facilitating RNA-RNA as well as RNA-protein interactions. In particular, the sugar edge of the purine on the 3' side of the pivotal uridine in the UA pair frequently forms a noncanonical base pair with a distant residue. The bulged-out bases, usually seen as part of the motif, also use their Watson-Crick edges to interact with nearby residues via base-specific hydrogen bonds. In certain occurrences, a backbone reversal is stabilized by specific hydrogen bonds as is observed in the U-turn motifs and the adenosine residue of the key UA pair interacts with a third base via its Watson-Crick edge, essentially generating a base triple.},

abstract = {The 30S ribosomal subunit has two primary functions in protein synthesis. It discriminates against aminoacyl transfer RNAs that do not match the codon of messenger RNA, thereby ensuring accuracy in translation of the genetic message in a process called decoding. Also, it works with the 50S subunit to move the tRNAs and associated mRNA by precisely one codon, in a process called translocation. Here we describe the functional implications of the high-resolution 30S crystal structure presented in the accompanying paper, and infer details of the interactions between the 30S subunit and its tRNA and mRNA ligands. We also describe the crystal structure of the 30S subunit complexed with the antibiotics paromomycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin, which interfere with decoding and translocation. This work reveals the structural basis for the action of these antibiotics, and leads to a model for the role of the universally conserved 16S RNA residues A1492 and A1493 in the decoding process.},

The diagrams attempt to map the underlying complex networks of base-base interactions and, especially, they aim at conveying key relationships between helical domains: co-axial stacking, bending and all Watson-Crick as well as non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Although such wiring diagrams cannot replace full stereographic images for correct spatial understanding and representation, they reveal structural similarities as well as the conserved patterns and distances between motifs which are present within the interaction networks of folded RNAs of similar or unrelated functions. Finally, the diagrams could help devising methods for meaningfully transforming RNA structures into graphs amenable to network analysis.},

@article{Petrov2013,
abstract = {The analysis of atomic-resolution RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures reveals that many internal and hairpin loops are modular, recurrent, and structured by conserved non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Structurally similar loops define RNA 3D motifs that are conserved in homologous RNA molecules, but can also occur at nonhomologous sites in diverse RNAs, and which often vary in sequence. To further our understanding of RNA motif structure and sequence variability and to provide a useful resource for structure modeling and prediction, we present a new method for automated classification of internal and hairpin loop RNA 3D motifs and a new online database called the RNA 3D Motif Atlas. To classify the motif instances, a representative set of internal and hairpin loops is automatically extracted from a nonredundant list of RNA-containing PDB files. Their structures are compared geometrically, all-against-all, using the FR3D program suite. The loops are clustered into motif groups, taking into account geometric similarity and structural annotations and making allowance for a variable number of bulged bases. The automated procedure that we have implemented identifies all hairpin and internal loop motifs previously described in the literature. All motif instances and motif groups are assigned unique and stable identifiers and are made available in the RNA 3D Motif Atlas (http://rna.bgsu.edu/motifs), which is automatically updated every four weeks. The RNA 3D Motif Atlas provides an interactive user interface for exploring motif diversity and tools for programmatic data access.},

The primary focus of this article is on the role of diffusive ions in RNA folding. Due to the long-range nature of electrostatic interactions, the diffuse ions can contribute significantly to RNA structural stability and folding kinetics. We present an overview of the experimental findings as well as the theoretical developments on the diffuse ion effects in RNA folding. This review places heavy emphasis on the effect of magnesium ions. Magnesium ions play a highly efficient role in stabilizing RNA tertiary structures and promoting tertiary structural folding. The highly efficient role goes beyond the mean-field effect such as the ionic strength. In addition to the effects of specific ion binding and ion dehydration, ion-ion correlation for the diffuse ions can contribute to the efficient role of the multivalent ions such as the magnesium ions in RNA folding.},

This adenosine platform opens the minor groove for base stacking or base pairing with nucleotides from a noncontiguous RNA strand. The platform motif has a distinctive chemical modification signature that may enable its detection in other structured RNAs. The ability of this motif to facilitate higher order folding provides one explanation for the abundance of adenosine residues in internal loops of many RNAs.},

The method exploits the modularity and the hierarchical folding of RNA architecture that is viewed as the assembly of preformed double-stranded helices defined by Watson-Crick base pairs and RNA modules maintained by non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Despite the extensive molecular neutrality observed in RNA structures, specificity in RNA folding is achieved through global constraints like lengths of helices, coaxiality of helical stacks, and structures adopted at the junctions of helices. The Assemble integrated suite of computer tools allows for sequence and structure analysis as well as interactive modeling by homology or ab initio assembly with possibilities for fitting within electronic density maps. The local key role of non-Watson-Crick pairs guides RNA architecture formation and offers metrics for assessing the accuracy of three-dimensional models in a more useful way than usual root mean square deviation (RMSD) values.},

The most populated family presents tertiary interactions between two helices as well as extensive shallow/minor groove contacts between a linking segment and the third helix.

With a number of crystal structures being solved with heavy metal derivatives and other "reporter" ions, sufficient information is available to estimate global similarities and differences in ion binding properties and to begin determining the influence of RNA and ions on each other. Here we will discuss the ions that are observed bound to RNA, their coordination properties, and the roles they play in RNA structural studies. Analysis of the crystallographic data reinforces the fact that ion interactions with nucleic acids are not easily interchanged between similarly charged ions. The physiological relevance of RNA-ion interactions, mainly involving K+ and Mg2+ cations, needs to be analyzed with care as different structures are solved under very diverse ionic conditions. The analysis is complicated by the fact that the assignment is not always accurate, often done under sub-optimal conditions, which further limits the generalization about the types of interactions these ions can establish.},

abstract = {The structures of ribosomal proteins and their interactions with RNA have been examined in the refined crystal structure of the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit. The protein structures fall into six groups based on their topology. The 50S subunit proteins function primarily to stabilize inter-domain interactions that are necessary to maintain the subunit's structural integrity. An extraordinary variety of protein-RNA interactions is observed. Electrostatic interactions between numerous arginine and lysine residues, particularly those in tail extensions, and the phosphate groups of the RNA backbone mediate many protein-RNA contacts. Base recognition occurs via both the minor groove and widened major groove of RNA helices, as well as through hydrophobic binding pockets that capture bulged nucleotides and through insertion of amino acid residues into hydrophobic crevices in the RNA. Primary binding sites on contiguous RNA are identified for 20 of the 50S ribosomal proteins, which along with few large protein-protein interfaces, suggest the order of assembly for some proteins and that the protein extensions fold cooperatively with RNA. The structure supports the hypothesis of co-transcriptional assembly, centered around L24 in domain I. Finally, comparing the structures and locations of the 50S ribosomal proteins from H.marismortui and D.radiodurans revealed striking examples of molecular mimicry. These comparisons illustrate that identical RNA structures can be stabilized by unrelated proteins.},

RNA hairpin and internal loops are often represented as unstructured on secondary structure diagrams, but RNA 3D structures show that most such loops are structured by non-Watson-Crick basepairs and base stacking. Moreover, different RNA sequences can form the same RNA 3D motif. JAR3D finds possible 3D geometries for hairpin and internal loops by matching loop sequences to motif groups from the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, by exact sequence match when possible, and by probabilistic scoring and edit distance for novel sequences. The scoring gauges the ability of the sequences to form the same pattern of interactions observed in 3D structures of the motif. The JAR3D webserver at http://rna.bgsu.edu/jar3d/ takes one or many sequences of a single loop as input, or else one or many sequences of longer RNAs with multiple loops. Each sequence is scored against all current motif groups. The output shows the ten best-matching motif groups. Users can align input sequences to each of the motif groups found by JAR3D. JAR3D will be updated with every release of the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, and so its performance is expected to improve over time.},

In this study, UV optical melting and a fluorescence competition assay are used to measure stabilities of multibranch loops containing up to five unpaired adenosines or uridines or a loop E motif. These results provide a test of our understanding of the factors affecting multibranch loop stability and provide revised parameters for predicting stability. The results should help to improve predictions of RNA secondary structure.},

abstract = {Pseudoknots are abundant in RNA structures. Many computational analyses require pseudoknot-free structures, which means that some of the base pairs in the knotted structure must be disregarded to obtain a nested structure. There is a surprising diversity of methods to perform this pseudoknot removal task, but these methods are often poorly described and studies can therefore be difficult to reproduce (in part, because different procedures may be intuitively obvious to different investigators). Here we provide a variety of algorithms for pseudoknot removal, some of which can incorporate sequence or alignment information in the removal process. We demonstrate that different methods lead to different results, which might affect structure-based analyses. This work thus provides a starting point for discussion of the extent to which these different methods recapture the underlying biological reality. We provide access to reference implementations through a web interface (at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/k2nwww), and the source code is available in the PyCogent project.},

Due to size and complexity, structural characterization of artificial RNA nanoobjects has been limited to low-resolution microscopy studies.

Despite the high symmetry on the level of secondary structure, the three-dimensional architecture of the square is asymmetric, with all four corners adopting distinct folding patterns.

abstract = {A significant fraction of the bases in a folded, structured RNA molecule participate in noncanonical base pairing interactions, often in the context of internal loops or multi-helix junction loops. The appearance of each new high-resolution RNA structure provides welcome data to guide efforts to understand and predict RNA 3D structure, especially when the RNA in question is a functionally conserved molecule. The recent publication of the crystal structure of the "Loop E" region of bacterial 5S ribosomal RNA is such an event [Correll CC, Freeborn B, Moore PB, Steitz TA, 1997, Cell 91:705-712]. In addition to providing more examples of already established noncanonical base pairs, such as purine-purine sheared pairings, trans-Hoogsteen UA, and GU wobble pairs, the structure provides the first high-resolution views of two new purine-purine pairings and a new GU pairing. The goal of the present analysis is to expand the capabilities of both chemical probing and phylogenetic analysis to predict with greater accuracy the structures of RNA molecules. First, in light of existing chemical probing data, we investigate what lessons could be learned regarding the interpretation of this widely used method of RNA structure probing. Then we analyze the 3D structure with reference to molecular phylogeny data (assuming conservation of function) to discover what alternative base pairings are geometrically compatible with the structure. The comparisons between previous modeling efforts and crystal structures show that the intricate involvements of ions and water molecules in the maintenance of non-Watson-Crick pairs render the process of correctly identifying the interacting sites in such pairs treacherous, except in cases of trans-Hoogsteen A/U or sheared A/G pairs for the adenine N1 site. The phylogenetic analysis identifies A/A, A/C, A/U and C/A, C/C, and C/U pairings isosteric with sheared A/G, as well as A/A and A/C pairings isosteric with both G/U and G/G bifurcated pairings. Thus, each non-Watson-Crick pair could be characterized by a phylogenetic signature of variations between isosteric-like pairings. In addition to the conservative changes, which form a dictionary of pairings isosterically compatible with those observed in the crystal structure, concerted changes involving several base pairs also occur. The latter covariations may indicate transitions between related but distinctive motifs within the loop E of 5S ribosomal RNA.},

abstract = {The functional centers of the ribosome in all organisms contain ribosomal RNA (rRNA) modifications, which are introduced by specialized enzymes and come at an energy cost for the cell. Surprisingly, none of the modifications tested so far was essential for growth and hence the functional role of modifications is largely unknown. Here, we show that the methyl groups of nucleosides m(2)G966 and m(5)C967 of 16S rRNA in Escherichia coli are important for bacterial fitness. In vitro analysis of all phases of translation suggests that the m(2)G966/m(5)C967 modifications are dispensable for elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. Rather, the modifications modulate the early stages of initiation by stabilizing the binding of fMet-tRNA(fMet) to the 30S pre-initiation complex prior to start-codon recognition. We propose that the m(2)G966 and m(5)C967 modifications help shaping the bacterial proteome, most likely by fine-tuning the rates that determine the fate of a given messenger RNA (mRNA) at early checkpoints of mRNA selection.},

@article{Leontis2002e,
abstract = {The traditional way to infer RNA secondary structure involves an iterative process of alignment and evaluation of covariation statistics between all positions possibly involved in basepairing. Watson-Crick basepairs typically show covariations that score well when examples of two or more possible basepairs occur. This is not necessarily the case for non-Watson-Crick basepairing geometries. For example, for sheared (trans Hoogsteen/Sugar edge) pairs, one base is highly conserved (always A or mostly A with some C or U), while the other can vary (G or A and sometimes C and U as well). RNA motifs consist of ordered, stacked arrays of non-Watson-Crick basepairs that in the secondary structure representation form hairpin or internal loops, multi-stem junctions, and even pseudoknots. Although RNA motifs occur recurrently and contribute in a modular fashion to RNA architecture, it is usually not apparent which bases interact and whether it is by edge-to-edge H-bonding or solely by stacking interactions. Using a modular sequence-analysis approach, recurrent motifs related to the sarcin-ricin loop of 23S RNA and to loop E from 5S RNA were predicted in universally conserved regions of the large ribosomal RNAs (16S- and 23S-like) before the publication of high-resolution, atomic-level structures of representative examples of 16S and 23S rRNA molecules in their native contexts. This provides the opportunity to evaluate the predictive power of motif-level sequence analysis, with the goal of automating the process for predicting RNA motifs in genomic sequences. The process of inferring structure from sequence by constructing accurate alignments is a circular one. The crucial link that allows a productive iteration of motif modeling and realignment is the comparison of the sequence variations for each putative pair with the corresponding isostericity matrix to determine which basepairs are consistent both with the sequence and the geometrical data. {\textcopyright} 2002 Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} fran{\c{c}}aise de biochimie et biologie mol{\'{e}}culaire / {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {Ethylnitrosourea is an alkylating reagent preferentially modifying phosphate groups in nucleic acids. It was used to monitor the tertiary structure, in solution, of yeast tRNAAsp and to determine those phosphate groups in contact with the cognate aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. Experiments involve 3' or 5'-end-labelled tRNA molecules, low yield modification of the free or complexed nucleic acid and specific splitting at the modified phosphate groups. The resulting end-labelled oligonucleotides are resolved on polyacrylamide sequencing gels and data analysed by autoradiography and densitometry. Experiments were conducted in parallel on yeast tRNAAsp and on tRNAPhe. In that way it was possible to compare the solution structure of two elongator tRNAs and to interpret the modification data using the known crystal structures of both tRNAs. Mapping of the phosphates in free tRNAAsp and tRNAPhe allowed the detection of differential reactivities for phosphates 8, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24 and 49: phosphates 18, 19, 23, 24 and 49 are more reactive in tRNAAsp, while phosphates 8, 20 and 22 are more reactive in tRNAPhe. All other phosphates display similar reactivities in both tRNAs, in particular phosphate 60 in the T-loop, which is strongly protected. Most of these data are explained by the crystal structures of the tRNAs. Thermal transitions in tRNAAsp could be followed by chemical modifications of phosphates. Results indicate that the D-arm is more flexible than the T-loop. The phosphates in yeast tRNAAsp in contact with aspartyl-tRNA synthetase are essentially contained in three continuous stretches, including those at the corner of the amino acid accepting and D-arm, at the 5' side of the acceptor stem and in the variable loop. When represented in the three-dimensional structure of the tRNAAsp, it clearly appears that one side of the L-shaped tRNA molecule, that comprising the variable loop, is in contact with aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. In yeast tRNAPhe interacting with phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, the distribution of protected phosphates is different, although phosphates in the anticodon stem and variable loop are involved in both systems. With tRNAPhe, the data cannot be accommodated by the interaction model found for tRNAAsp, but they are consistent with the diagonal side model proposed by Rich {\&} Schimmel (1977). The existence of different interaction schemes between tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, correlated with the oligomeric structure of the enzyme, is proposed.},

abstract = {Bacteria encode multiple type II toxin-antitoxin modules that cleave ribosome-bound mRNAs in response to stress. All ribosome-dependent toxin family members structurally characterized to date adopt similar microbial RNase architectures despite possessing low sequence identities. Therefore, determining which residues are catalytically important in this specialized RNase family has been a challenge in the field. Structural studies of RelE and YoeB toxins bound to the ribosome provided significant insights but biochemical experiments with RelE were required to clearly demonstrate which residues are critical for acid-base catalysis of mRNA cleavage. Here, we solved an X-ray crystal structure of the wild-type, ribosome-dependent toxin HigB bound to the ribosome revealing potential catalytic residues proximal to the mRNA substrate. Using cell-based and biochemical assays, we further determined that HigB residues His54, Asp90, Tyr91 and His92 are critical for activity in vivo, while HigB H54A and Y91A variants have the largest effect on mRNA cleavage in vitro Comparison of X-ray crystal structures of two catalytically inactive HigB variants with 70S-HigB bound structures reveal that HigB active site residues undergo conformational rearrangements likely required for recognition of its mRNA substrate. These data support the emerging concept that ribosome-dependent toxins have diverse modes of mRNA recognition.},

abstract = {It has long been accepted that the structural constraints stemming from the 3D structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) lead to coevolution through compensating mutations between interacting sites. State-of-the-art methods for detecting coevolving sites, however, while reaching high levels of specificity and sensitivity for Watson-Crick (WC) pairs of the helices defining the secondary structure, only scarcely reveal tertiary interactions occurring at the level of the 3D structure. In order to understand the relative failure of coevolutionary methods to detect such interactions, we analyze 2,682 interacting sites derived from high-resolution structures, which include a comprehensive data set of rRNA sequences from Archaea and Bacteria. We report a striking difference in the amount of coevolution between WC and non-WC pairs. In order to understand this pattern, we derive fitness landscapes from the geometry of base pairing interactions and construct neutral networks of substitutions for each type of interaction. These networks show that coevolution is a property of WC pairs because, unlike non-WC pairs, their landscapes exhibit fitness valleys, a single mutation in a WC pair resulting in a fitness drop. Second, we used the inferred neutral networks to estimate the level of constraint acting on each type of base pair and show that it correlates negatively with the observed rate of substitutions for all non-WC pairs. WC pairs appear as outliers, fixing more substitutions than expected according to their level of constraint. We here propose that the rate of substitution in WC pairs is due to coevolution resulting from constraints acting at intermediate levels of organization, namely the one of the helical stem with its forming WC pairs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report a significant excess of intrahelical, inter-WC pairs coevolution compared with interhelices pairs. Altogether, these results show that detailed biochemical knowledge is required and has to be incorporated into evolutionary reasoning in order to understand the fine patterns of variation at the molecular level. They also demonstrate that coevolutionary analysis provides almost exclusively 2D information and only little 3D signal.},

abstract = {Many hairpin and internal RNA 3D motif structures are recurrent, occurring in various types of RNA molecules, not necessarily homologs. Although usually drawn as single-strand “loops” in RNA 2D diagrams, recurrent motifs share a common 3D structure, but can vary in sequence. It is essential to understand the sequence variability of RNA 3D motifs in order to advance the RNA 2D and 3D structure prediction and ncRNA discovery methods, to interpret mutations that affect ncRNAs, and to guide experimental functional studies. The dissertation is organized into two parts as follows. First, the development of a new online resource called RNA 3D Hub is described, which is intended to provide a useful resource for structure modeling and prediction. It houses non-redundant sets of RNA-containing 3D structures, RNA 3D motifs extracted from all RNA 3D structures, and the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, a representative collection of RNA 3D motifs. Unique and stable ids are assigned to all non-redundant equivalence classes of structure files, to all motifs, and to all motif instances. RNA 3D Hub is updated automatically on a regular schedule and is available at http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub. In the second part of the dissertation, the development of WebFR3D (http://rna.bgsu.edu/webfr3d), a new webserver for finding and aligning RNA 3D motifs, is described and its use in a biologically relevant context is then illustrated using two RNA 3D motifs. The first motif was predicted in Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd), and the prediction was supported by functional evidence. The second motif had previously been undescribed, although it is found in multiple 3D structures. RNA 3D Hub, RNA 3D Motif Atlas, and the bioinformatic techniques discussed in this dissertation lay the groundwork for further research into RNA 3D motif prediction starting from sequence and provide useful online resources for the scientific community worldwide.},
