\chapter{SELECTION OF LOOPS FOR CLUSTERING IN THE RNA 3D MOTIF ATLAS FROM THE
REPRESENTATIVE SET OF STRUCTURES}

In this chapter I will discuss the changes I have made to the way the BGSU RNA
pipeline selects loops for building the RNA 3D Motif Atlas
(\href{http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/motifs}{http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/motifs}).
The goal of our Motif Atlas is to maintain a high quality, up-to-date clustering
of representative RNA 3D Motifs (hairpin, internal, and multi helix junction
loops) from the 3D structure database, on an ongoing basis. An important step in
building the Motif Atlas is the selection of loops. The original process of
selecting loops was implemented by Dr. Anton Petrov in previous work
\cite{Petrov2012}. Overall, the procedure worked as follows: First, all loops
from all representative structures from all 4.0{\AA} equivalence classes are
extracted. This representative structure was always the longest chain in a given PDB
file. Shorter RNA molecules were ignored, for example the 5S in from the LSU
rRNA. Then each loop was examined for the presence of possible structural flaws,
which serve as criteria for removal. The loop exclusion criteria criteria
included:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Presence of chain breaks in the loop. Chain breaks occur when the
    phosphate backbone of the molecule is not continuous. This occurs due to
    incomplete modeling, due, for example, to a lack of electron density in the
    affected region.

  \item Presence of a self-complementary sequence in a nominally unpaired
    internal loop. These loops are often a poorly modeled helices that appear as
    loops in our method because the pairs fall outside our annotation limits.

  \item Presence of incomplete nucleotides. Incomplete nucleotides occur when
    only part of a nucleotide is modeled. In some structures, only electron
    density for the backbone is observed, leading to models that lack the base
    at some nucleotide positions
\end{enumerate}

% Examples of these structural issues are shown in
% Figure~\ref{fig:loops-with-issues}. These criteria all examine the structure of
% the loops for signs of data incompleteness or modeling flaws. If any loop shows
% one these problems it is rejected from clustering.

%   \label{fig:loops-with-issues}
% \end{figure}

In addition to these structural issues, the previous procedure also rejected
loops were been incorrectly extracted. This occurred when a single loop
contained too many chains. For example, an internal loop composed of three or more
chains was be rejected. An example of such a loop IL\_3OL6\_001 is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:too-many-chains}. This loop contains 3 chains, where as a 
valid internal loop should comprise no more than two chains.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter-5/figs/loops/IL-3OL6-001}
  \caption{3D structure of an internal loop with too many chains. This loop
    IL\_3OL6\_001 is rejected by our loop quality procedures because it contains
    too many chains, 3 in this case, loops for a valid internal loop. The
  nucleotides in the loop are colored by the chain, green for chain J, purple
for chain L and cyan for chain K.}
  \label{fig:too-many-chains}
\end{figure}

Finally, the previous method rejected loops that contain nucleotide
modifications. This is because our current FR3D annotation software cannot
process modified bases \cite{Sarver2008a}. We are currently working on removing
this limitation. An example of such a loop is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:modified-loop}. This loop contains a single modified base, G7M
2069, and is therefore excluded from clustering.

  This internal loop is currently rejected with our loop quality steps but only
  because or programs no yet annotate interactions for modified nucleotides.}
  \label{fig:modified-loop}
\end{figure}

My changes to the loop selection process are in three areas: First, I improved
the selection criteria to take advantage of additional information available in
mmCIF data. For example, mmCIF files includes information on atom occupancy.
Secondly, I altered the logic to include the capability to exclude loops from
cryo-EM data for some versions of the Motif Atlas. Finally, I have used a
measure of modeling quality, Real Space Refinement Z-Score (RSR-Z), to exclude
loops outside certain suitable statistical limits. I tested different thresholds for
RSR-Z and evaluated their effects to establish suitable cutoffs to use in the
pipeline. I will discuss each of these changes in turn.

\section{Modifications to Previous Loop Selection Methodology}

The first change was to take advantage of new information in mmCIF data. This
change affected two of the criteria, how the presence of chain breaks and
the presence of incomplete nucleotides are detected.

Previously, chain breaks were detected by measuring the distance between the
phosphate atom of one nucleotide and the O3` of the preceding nucleotide. This
distance should be less than 2{\AA} \cite{Petrov2012} when a covalent bond is
present. This approach requires computing bond distances between all successive
pairs of nucleotides and comparison to a free parameter that requires selection.
The new format, mmCIF, provides a mapping between the ``observed sequence'' and
the ``experimental sequence''. In this mapping, chain breaks are detected as
nucleotide positions in the ``experimental sequence'' that are not mapped to
``observed sequence'' positions, i.e. the nucleotides for which no 3D coordinates are
provided. By using the experimental sequence mapping, we no longer need to
measure distances in the structure to make this decision. The reader should note
the distinction between ``experimental'' and ``observed'' sequences data fields
in mmCIF files.

The second affected criterion, presence of incomplete nucleotides, has been
extended to include atoms with zero occupancy. The previous procedure rejected
any loop that contained any nucleotide that lacked all the required atoms. This
occurs when an author chooses not to model a nucleotide because of missing  or
incomplete electron density data. However, many careful authors now model
nucleotides for which there is incomplete data by marking any atoms of that
nucleotide that have incomplete data as having ``zero occupancy''. My new
procedure will now detect these cases by checking the occupancy data for each
atom of each nucleotide of the loop. In the case that the occupancy for one or
more atoms in a loop is zero, the entire loop is excluded from clustering. The
new logic is more rigorous and removes more loops than the previous method.
Table~\ref{tab:loop-quality-changes} compares the effects the new selection
criteria to the last Motif Atlas with the Petrov method on the same December 2014
set of loops (v1.18).

Finally, when beginning to work with mmCIF data, I found a bug in our loop
extraction procedure that inadvertently extracted loops formed by molecules
related by symmetry operators in the crystal structures. To fix this bug I added
a new criterion to ensure that we do not extract loops formed by nucleotides
generated by more than one symmetry operator. In other words, we do not extract
loops created by crystal contacts between RNA chains belonging to different
IFE's.

These changes alter the loop selection logic. Shown in
Table~\ref{tab:loop-quality-changes} is a comparison of the numbers of loops
affected when using the new and previous method. I took all accepted loops from
the Motif Atlas Release 1.18 (December 2014), which are from representative
structures from the 2.85 Representative release and determined their status
using the new logic. The counts are compared in
Table~\ref{tab:loop-quality-changes}, which shows that that the majority of
loops will have the same classifications, but a small percent do change.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{LLRRRR}

    Hairpin Loops  & 736 & 708 & 15 & 6 & 7 \\

  affected by the changes to the selection procedure to address incomplete or
  flawed loop data or models. The number in parenthesis in the header indicates
  the representative release for that column.}
  \label{tab:loop-quality-changes}
\end{table}

\section{Exclusion of loops from cryo-Electron Microscopy}

The next change to loop selection, exclusion of loops from cryo-EM structures,
is a simple addition with a large effect. Currently, X-Ray structure
determination is the ``gold standard'' of structural methods for large
biomolecules. There is a great deal of exciting work using cryo-electron
microscopy (\cyem) to determine structures of large biomolecules that form
multiple conformational states \cite{Amunts2014, Quade2015, Schureck2016}.
However, this technique is under rapid development and still lacks defined
criteria for assessing structural quality on a par with the standards that are
already well-established for X-ray structures \cite{Henderson2012}. We plan to
carry out the loop extraction procedure in two ways, with and without loops
loops that come from structures solved by \cyem, until defined criteria are
established and we can integrate reliable cryo-EM loops in the ``gold standard''
Motif Atlas release. Comparison of the two releases with and without \cyem{}
will allow monitoring of new motif geometries that are only found in \cyem{}
structures.

Rejecting loops from \cyem{} structures has a large effect on the number of
loops available for clustering. As a test of this I extracted all loops from the
representative set (release 2.86) described in the previous chapter, and then
counted the number of valid loops from each source.  Shown in
Table~\ref{tab:source-counts} is a summary of counts of valid internal loops
obtained both ways.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{LLRRRRRR}
    \toprule
                             &                 & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Number of Valid Internal Loops} \\
    \cmidrule(r){3-5}
    Representative           & Number of IFE's & X-ray & \cyem & Total \\
    \midrule
    1.18 (December 05, 2014) & 858  & 1653 (69\%) & 757 (31\%)  & 2410 (100\%) \\
    2.85 (July 28, 2016)     & 1232 & 1945 (50\%) & 1951 (50\%) & 3896 (100\%) \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabulary}
  \caption{Counts of the number of valid loops from X-ray vs \cyem{} structures.
  This table highlights the large growth of \cyem{} loops.}
  \label{tab:source-counts}
\end{table}

The comparison in Table~\ref{tab:source-counts} shows that there is a large
growth over the past \TILDE 20 months in the number of loops present in from
\cyem{} structures.

When not using \cyem{} loops, we reduce the number of internal loops available
for clustering in release 2.85 by half ,
from 3896 to 1945. This total is fewer than the number available in the
previous motif release, 2410. This change has a large effect on the selection of
loops and thus the final clustering of motifs.

\section{Usage of Real Space Refinement (RSR) Statistics for loop selection}

The final change implemented to the loop selection procedure is the use of modeling
quality data from PDB as an additional criterion measuring how well 3D models
determined by X-ray crystallography reflect the underlying electron density. The
Petrov \etal{} selection procedure successfully detected structural
deficiencies of the loops but did not consider modeling issues
\cite{Petrov2012}. The new changes apply the modeling criteria recently made
available by PDB for each X-ray structure, the Real Space Refinement (RSR)
measure and the RSR Z-Score (RSR-Z) statistical score. RSR directly measures
how well the 3D model fits the underlying experimental electron density. I begin
with a discussion of the new RSR-Z scores and discuss the modifications to our
quality criteria and their consequences on the numbers of structures retained.

\subsection{Description of Real Space Refinement and the associated Z-Score}

Real Space Refinement (RSR) is a measure of how well the atomic resolution 3D
model present in a PDB file fits the observed, underlying electron density
obtained by X-ray diffraction. This was originally described by Jones \etal{} in
the development of Uppsala validation server \cite{Kleywegt2004a}. RSR is
calculated using equation:
\begin{equation}
  RSR = \frac{\sum \mid \rho_{obs} - \rho_{calc} \mid}
             {\sum \mid \rho_{obs} + \rho_{calc} \mid}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is electron density. 

In words this equation computes the normalized difference between the observed
electron density and modeled electron density. I explored the distribution of
the RSR values for all nucleotides in loops. This is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rsr-nt-distribution}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Histograms of the distribution of RSR, left side, and RSR-Z, right
  side, values for nucleotides in loops. Each panel represents a different
  residue. The loop used are all accepted loops from Representative release
  2.85. The blue bars indicate the mean of each distribution, while the number
  next to each bar shows the value of the median and standard deviation.}
  \label{fig:nt-quality-distribution}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:rsr-nt-distribution} shows that Guanine has the lowest median
RSR value of $0.17 \pm 0.07$, while the highest value is shared between Uracil
with a median of $0.19 \pm 0.1$. These distributions have a long tail that goes
near 2.5 (a Cytosine). These distributions do appear to differ because of their
very small standard deviations.

However, there are several issues with directly using RSR as the criterion for
evaluation loop quality. RSR however \cite{Tickle2012}. To deal with these
issues, the corresponding Z-score, statistical measure, RSR-Z, has been proposed
for general use \cite{Gore2012}. The Real Space Z-Score (RSR-Z) is a normalized
version of RSR calculated by PDB as described in \cite{Gore2012}. This data is
calculated for each structure on a residue level, by computing RSR Z-Scores for
each type of residue present in the structure and comparing to like residues in
all other comparable structures of similar resolution, e.g. A's are compared to
other A's, while C's are compared to other C's \cite{Gore2012, Kleywegt2004a},
etc. PDB provides this statistic as part of their validation reports and the
data is imported as part of our weekly update pipeline. These data are available
on the PDB FTP site, using URLs that depend upon the structure, for example the
data for 1FJG are available at:
\URL{http://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/validation\_reports/fj/1fjg/}. In this way,
the quality of each structure is compared to other structures of comparable
resolution, as well as to all other X-ray structures in PDB that contain RNA
\cite{Gore2012}.

\subsection{Determining suitable criteria for using RSR-Z to reject loops}

We begin by examining the distribution of RSR-Z data for each type of loop in the
representative set of 3D structures selected as described in the previous
chapter, which corresponds to the v2.85 representative structure release,
available at (\URL{http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/nrlist/release/2.85}). The
distribution of such data are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rsrz-distribution}. This
figure shows that loop nucleotides have median RSR-Z values near 0, indicating a
good fit to observed density. We can also see a long tail in the RSR-Z
distribution that indicates a large range in the quality of modeling. The reader
should note that an RSR-Z value of 2 indicates two standard deviations, so
values greater than 2 correspond to outlier data. This is shown on the graphs as
a red bar.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter-5/figs/loops/rsrz-distribution}
  \caption{Distribution of RSR-Z values by loop for nucleotides in all accepted
  loops in NR version v2.85. The nucleotides are only from loops that pass all
  structural criteria.}
  \label{fig:rsrz-distribution}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:rsrz-distribution} supports the conclusions of the previous
chapter that appropriate criteria are used to select the representative
structure because the median values are near zero, indicating good modeling.
However, there is a long tail in the RSR-Z distribution corresponding to
nucleotides with very high RSR-Z values. Loops containing poorly modeled
nucleotides should be excluded from clustering and inclusion in the 3D Motif
Atlas. When the distributions are examined on the basis of nucleotide, as shown
in Figure~/ref{fig:rsrz-nt-distribution}, the means are all slightly above zero,
near 0.13. This shows that while loops as a whole are modeled better, the
individual nucleotides are 

I used RSR-Z values to create two criteria for screening loops. The first is
that all bases in a loop must be reasonably well modeled, that is if all
nucleotides in the loop have a low RSR-Z values, that is, if all nucleotides in
a loop have RSR-Z values above a suitably chosen, fairly low RSR-Z value (e.g.
1) that loop should not be included. I propose this cutoff to ensure that no
``fictional loops'' are included. This will also be referred to as ``Cutoff 1''.
We do not consider if the bases are interacting in this criterion because some
loops do not contain interactions. 

Secondly, is that all nucleotides that make interactions with other bases within
the loop must have RSR-Z values below a suitably chosen, somewhat higher second
cutoff. This criterion is used because I expect that loops interacting within a
loop will generally have lower RSR-Z values by virtue of being ``fixed in place''
by these interactions. If any nucleotides are above this cutoff (e.g. about 2),
the whole loop should be rejected. This is the ``Interacting NT'' cutoff or
``Cutoff 2''.

\subsection{Detecting fictional loops}

The first criterion is that all bases in a loop should be sufficiently well
modeled. A well modeled base has a low RSR-Z value, thus a poorly modeled loop is
one where all modeled bases in the loop have a RSR-Z value above a fairly strict
cutoff. I will refer to these loops as ``fictional'' as they are not supported
by the experimental density. 

I am interested in exploring the effect of various RSR-Z cutoffs on motif
clustering so we will use a range of RSR-Z values to detect fictional loops. We
have been advised by Helen Berman at PDB to use an RSR-Z threshold of 2 to
identify nucleotides that are poorly modeled. This is consistent with they
validation reports that to detect regions of poor modeling. However, they did
not specify if this cutoff would work well for detection of fictional loops, or
just poorly modeled individual nucleotides. Thus, I tested cutoffs of 1, 1.5, 2 and
2.5 to explore the effect of various cutoffs on motif clustering. I applied this
criterion, all nucleotides in the loop must have an RSR-Z less than the cutoff,
to all valid loops in the dataset. A summary of the number of loops sorted by
this criterion into successive ranges of RSR-Z in
Table~\ref{tab:cutoffs-reject-summary}.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{llrrrr}
    \toprule
              &                   & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Number of Loops Rejected by Fictional Loop Cutoff} \\

    Counts of the number of loops of each type rejected by the criteria that

    loops solved by X-ray from the NR release 2.85 that met the structure
    quality criteria, except RSR-Z.}
  \label{tab:cutoffs-reject-summary}
\end{table}

As expected, the lower the values of the RSR-Z criterion, the more loops are
rejected. However, even for the lowest value used, RSR-Z value of 1, a relatively
small small number of loop instances are rejected. This indicates that our
current representative set has few low-quality loops.

Manual inspection of the rejected loops shows that some but not all appear to be
poorly structured. A ``structured'' loop is one that has several annotated
interactions, while an ``unstructured'' loop has few if any. An example of a
poorly structured loop is HL\_4DR7\_033 as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:hl-4dr7-033}. All nucleotides in this loop have RSR-Z values
greater than 3. While this loop passes all other quality criteria, the high
RSR-Z scores indicate it is poorly modeled. These are the types of loops I
expected to reject with this method. However, in some cases loops that appear
unstructured actually are tightly bound to proteins and form multiple base-amino
acid interactions. These are expected to have low RSR-Z values and are accepted
by the method.

      solved at 2.6\angstrom{} resolution \cite{Robertson2007}.}

\end{figure}

Others loops, such as HL\_2OIU\_002 as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hl-2oiu-002},
appear to be well structured loops but poorly modeled. We believe this is
because the modeling procedure for a new structure is to begin with a previous
structures and modify parts to better fit the data. In some regions, the
previous structure is not modified enough to fit the data, or new experiment has
no density in this region. This leads to the creation of an ``appealing fiction'',
where the structure appears reasonable but it is not experimental supported. I 
apply a strict criterion where if all nucleotides in a loop have an RSR-Z value
above a threshold, I call the loop ``fictional''. The loop may still be highly
structure and appear reasonable, however, but it is not based upon actual
electron density.

\subsection{Detection of loops containing poorly modeled interacting nucleotides}

The next use for RSR-Z is to explore the relationship between RSR-Z values and
the number of annotated interactions. I wish to ask if nucleotides that are
making more interactions will have a lower RSR-Z score as opposed to nucleotides
that make fewer interactions. This is because bases that lack interactions are
expected to be freer and thus adopt a variety of conformations in the crystal,
leading to diffuse electron density. With diffuse data any single modeled
position fits experimental electron density poorly resulting in a high RSR-Z
value.

I explored this question by plotting the distribution of RSR-Z values for all
nucleotides in loops as a function of the number of FR3D-annotated interactions
present in the BGSU database records for each nucleotide in
Figure~\ref{fig:rsrz-dist}. This figure is a 'violin plot', a graphical
representation originally developed in \cite{Hintze1998}. Violin plots are
mixtures of density estimations and box plots. In Figure~\ref{fig:rsrz-dist} all
nucleotides making the same number of interactions are grouped together and a
density estimate for each group is produced. The estimate is plotted along each
row and is referred to as a ``density trace'' or ``trace'' for this description.
The range of the trace indicates the range of the values. The width of the trace
at any region indicates the fraction of all nucleotides are in this region,
smoothed by a kernel density estimate \cite{Hintze1998}.

In this figure I included in the counts all types of annotated interactions,
base pairs, base stacks, and base backbone interactions. This plot shows that
there is a broad range of RSR-Z values regardless of the numbers of
interactions. However, this range is largest for nucleotides having no
interactions (0). The large range of RSR-Z values makes it difficult to plot the
number of outliers in each group. To ameliorate this I created a truncated
version of this plot to visualize the number of outliers for each number of
interactions as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:truncated-rsrz-dist}. In this figure
the RSR-Z values are truncated at a value of 3. Thus the RSR-Z values of all
nucleotides having RSR-Z values above 3 were set to 3, effectively ``squashing''
the violin plots to fit in a smaller space.

From this more focused figure we can see that there are far fewer RSR-Z outliers
for nucleotides forming three or more annotated interactions (the tails becore
become skinnier as interactions increase) across all loop types. Another useful
detailed examination of this data is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:rsrz-by-interaction-means}. This table shows the mean and
standard deviation of all the distributions shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:truncated-rsrz-dist}.

This table shows that the highest median value occurs for bases that make no
interactions, and the median gently decreases as the number of interactions
increase. The RSR-Z value for nucleotides in internal loops with zero
interactions is $0.63 \pm 1.68$, while for three it is $-0.02 \pm 0.74$ and for
six it is $0.07 \pm 0.48$ as shown in Table~\ref{tab:rsrz-by-interaction-means}.
This means that bases that make fewer interactions generally fit the electron
density less well, mean of 0.63 vs -0.02, and have a much higher variability in
their modeling, standard deviation of 1.68 vs 0.74.

\end{table}

These observations generally confirm the expectation that nucleotides with
interactions have lower mean RSR-Z values and less variability in modeling. Thus
I implemented an additional criterion, that if any interacting nucleotide has an
RSR-Z values above a cutoff the loop is be excluded. I refer to this criterion
as the ``Interacting Nt'' criterion and the cutoff value used as ``Cutoff 2''.
Operationally, Cutoff 2 will always be greater than or equal to Cutoff 1. As
with the previous criterion it is necessary to determine its effect on
clustering. Shown in Table~\ref{tab:interacting-cutoff} is a summary of the
number of loops excluded by this method for each value of Cutoff 2. In other
words, a loop is excluded if one or more interacting nucleotides has RSR-Z
\textgreater{} Cutoff 2.

\end{table}

As for Cutoff 1, increasing RSR-Z Cutoff 2 decreases the number of loops
excluded. However, changing Cutoff 2 produces a much larger effect on the number
of loops excluded. The highest number of internal loops excluded, 419, occurs for
Cutoff 2 set to 1, on the other hand, only 19 loops are rejected with Cutoff 1
set to 1.

We use the two criteria described here to build a composite, two-step RSR-Z
quality assurance protocol; step 1: if all nucleotides in a loop have an RSR-Z
value above the Cutoff 1 (the fictional loop criterion) the loop is rejected.
Step 2: if any interacting nucleotide has an RSR-Z above Cutoff 2 (the
Interacting Nt criterion), the loop is rejected. Note that Cutoff 1 is less than
or equal to Cutoff 2. This logic is summarized in the pseudocode shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pseudo-rsrz-logic}. I use a range of cutoffs, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5
to explore the effect on number of loops excluded. For the study summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:rsrz-reject-summary} here I used the same RSR-Z value for both
cutoffs. The total number of loops rejected by this method are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:rsrz-reject-summary}.

I then tested the effects of simultaneously varying Cutoff 1 and Cutoff 2 over

that are excluded, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:il-rsrz-cutoffs-combinations} and

These tables show interesting differences. Notably that the majority of loops
are rejected because of poorly modeled interactions (the None column for the
fictional cutoff is normally the values in all other columns). However, there
are a few hairpin loops which are detected as ``fictional'' (Cutoff 1) which are not detected
with the Interacting Nt (Cutoff 2) criterion (The columns with a fictional
cutoff of 1 and interacting cutoff of 2 or 2.5).

Using these tables I set the value of the two RSR-Z cutoffs, so that fictional
loops are detected and excluded with an RSR-Z threshold of 1 (Cutoff 1 = 1),
while loops with poorly modeled interacting nucleotides are detected with an
RSR-Z threshold of 2 (Cutoff 2 = 2). This combination of Cutoff 1 and Cutoff 2
leads to the exclusion of 132 internal loops and 188 hairpin loops from the data
set.

\section{Exploring the effects of the new quality criteria on motif clustering}

To explore the effect of the new quality metrics on clustering, I built a Motif
Atlas release of internal loops using the representative release built in the
previous chapter (v2.86). This clustering was used to test the effects of the
new quality criteria on motif clustering. The quality criteria did not include
the RSR-Z cutoffs developed above. This Motif Atlas version was used to examine
the effects of imposing the RSR-Z criteria on the number of internal loop Motif
Groups, singleton and recurrent. Doing so makes the comparisons of the resulting
motif clusterings simpler because changing the loops used will have many effects
on the resulting clustering.

I discuss the effects of the new quality criteria on the loops, followed by a
general description of the motif clustering and then discuss the effects of
applying the RSR-Z cutoffs to the number of motifs.

\subsection{Summary of the new loop quality criteria}

The first step in the motif clustering is to select loops that pass all the
quality checks. Shown in Table~\ref{tab:current-loop-quality} are the numbers of
loops rejected by each criterion from the representative IFE's from the 4.0{\AA}
resolution cutoff.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{LCCCCCCCCCC}
    \rot{Loop Type} &
      \rot{Total Loops} &
      \rot{Missing Nucleotides} &
      \rot{Abnormal Chain Number} &
      \rot{Incomplete Nucleotides} &
      \rot{Self-Complementary Internal Loop} &
      \rot{Too Many Symmetry Operators} &
      \rot{Subtotal with Flaws} &
      \rot{Modified Nucleotides} &
      \rot{cryo-EM loops} &
      \rot{Accepted Loops} \\
    \midrule
    Hairpin Loop & 2748 (100\%) & 171 (6\%) & 2 (0.07\%) & 35 (1\%)   & 0         & 27 (1\%) & 235 (9\%) & 103 (4\%) & 757 (27\%)  & 1653 (60\%) \\
    Internal Loop & 4334 (100\%) & 54 (1\%) & 6 (0.1\%)  & 20 (0.5\%) & 162 (4\%) & 55 (1\%) & 297 (7\%) & 151 (3\%) & 1951 (45\%) & 1945 (45\%) \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabulary}
  \caption{Counts of the loops that are rejected by each quality criteria for
  all loops that come from a representative IFE from the 2.85 representative
  release with resolution cutoff of 4.0{\AA}.}
  \label{tab:current-loop-quality}
\end{table}

From this table we can see that 151, or 3\%, internal loops are rejected on the
basis of modified nucleotides. This differs from the previous clustering where
0.9\% of loops were rejected \cite{Petrov2012}. In addition, the largest
fraction of loops, 45\%, are rejected because they are from \cyem{} structures.

\subsection{Description of the properties of the new motif atlas}

I used the loops that passed our updated quality checks, but not the new RSR-Z
constraints, that were less than 15 nucleotides in length to build a Motif Atlas
for testing the effects of different RSR-Z thresholds. The additional constraint
of 15 nucleotides only reduced the total number of valid loops to 1757 from 1945
and was done to ensure the analysis completed quickly. This clustering produced
a grouping with 256 internal loop motif families. This is a large change from
the 372 motif families in the previous release without RSR-Z checks. Shown in
Table~\ref{tab:loop-counts} is a summary of the number of motif families from
the release described here as compared to the previous release. The table
includes the counts of singleton motif families, defined as motif groups
composed of just one instance, and the recurrent motifs, families with more than
one instance. Loops which are placed into a motif group are referred to as motif
instances or simply instances.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{lrrrrrrr}
    \toprule
                  &                                      & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Singleton Groups} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Recurrent Groups} \\
    \cmidrule(r){3-5} \cmidrule(r){6-8}
    Motif Release &
      Motif Groups &
      Total & X-Ray & cryo-EM &
      Total & X-Ray & cryo-EM \\
    \midrule
    1.18 (December 2014) & 372 & 175 & 108 & 197 & 197 &     &   \\
    2.0 (July 2016)      & 256 & 109 & 109 & 0   & 147 & 147 & 0 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A table summarizing the number of internal loop motif groups in the
  previous motif release as compared to the new release. }
  \label{tab:loop-counts}
\end{table}

From this table we can see that the overall ratio of singleton to recurrent
groups remains relatively constant in both releases, with both clusterings being
nearly evenly split between singleton and recurrent motifs. In addition we see
that a large fraction of the previous singletons, 29\% of all motif groups
overall and 62\% of all singleton groups, come from \cyem{} structures. There is
a smaller fraction of singletons in the v2.0 release, 43\% as compared to the
47\% for the previous release (v1.18), however, the change is fairly small.

I next examined the sizes of the motifs in the new clustering. Shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:num-motif-instances} is the size distribution in terms of number
of motif instances in all motifs motif. From this figure we can see there are 50
singleton motif groups and two groups with around 250 members.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter-5/figs/motifs/instances}
  \caption{Histogram of the number of motif instances in all motif groups. This
  figure shows the number of instances in all motif groups built in this chapter.}
  \label{fig:num-motif-instances}
\end{figure}

This figure shows a large spike at 1, indicating the large number of singleton
motifs in the clustering. The majority of motifs have fewer than 50 instances,
with only 2 motifs having near greater than 200 instances.

The next consideration is the distribution of the number of nucleotides in the
motifs. Show in Figure~\ref{fig:num-motif-nucleotides} is the distribution of
the number of nucleotides in each motif.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter-5/figs/motifs/nucleotides}
  \caption{Histogram of the number of nucleotides in all motifs in a data set
  limited to internal loops of size less than 15. This figure shows the counts
  of nucleotides in all Internal Loops in the Motif release built in this
  chapter.}
  \label{fig:num-motif-nucleotides}
\end{figure}

This figure shows the overall size distribution of internal loop motifs for all
motifs in the test motif atlas release. It is useful to know the sizes of each
class of motifs, singleton and recurrent. Shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:num-nt-by-class} is this information. This figure shows that
singleton motifs tend to be larger, with a mean size of 9.5 nucleotides as
opposed to the mean of 8.5 nucleotides for recurrent motifs.


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter-5/figs/motifs/nucleotides-by-type}
  \caption{Histogram of the number of nucleotides in for singleton as compared
  to recurrent motifs. This figure shows the counts of nucleotides in all
  Internal Loops in the Motif release built in this chapter. The blue lines
  indicate the means of the distributions.}
  \label{fig:num-nt-by-class}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Exploration of the effects of RSR-Z cutoffs on the motif clustering}

I then explored what happens to the motif atlas when the RSR-Z cutoffs are
applied. This was done by examining each motif for loops that are rejected by
each RSR-Z cutoff and determining whether the motif group persists. To do this I
determined which motifs in the test motif atlas are altered when imposing
various RSR-Z criteria. For this study I set both Cutoff 1 and Cutoff 2 to the
same value. That is, I examined what motifs would be altered when excluding
fictional loops at an RSR-Z of 1 and interacting NT's of
1 as compared to RSR-Z values of 1.5, 2, and 2.5.

I explored two main questions. First, what type of motifs are excluded?
Secondly, are the loops excluded geometrically distinct from the loop instances
that remain, i.e. pass the RSR-Z criteria? These questions are explored below.

\subsubsection{What types of motifs are excluded by imposing the RSR-Z criterion}

To answer the first question, I explored the types of motif groups, singleton or
recurrent, that would be altered for each value of the RSR-Z criteria. Shown in
Table~\ref{tab:loop-motif-fraction} is the fraction of loops in each type of
motif that are excluded by the RSR-Z cutoffs. From this table we can see that
the RSR-Z criteria eliminate more instances from singleton families then
recurrent families. This is most visible in the \rsrz{2.5} where 4.7\% of all
instances are rejected. If the criterion effected singleton and recurrent motifs
equally then I would expect to see a roughly 4.7\% of singleton and recurrent
motif instances being rejected. However, only 4.3\% of instances in recurrent
motifs are rejected while 11.0\% of instances in singleton motifs are rejected.
The effect on singleton groups is to complete eliminate these groups as a whole.
By contrast no recurrent internal loop groups are eliminated. This indicates
that the singleton instances are disproportionally rejected as compared to
recurrent instances.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{LLrrrr}
  \toprule
  & & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Number of Internal Loop Instances Excluded at} \\
        \cmidrule(r){3-6}
  Motif Type & Total Instances & \rsrz{1}     & \rsrz{1.5}   & \rsrz{2}    & \rsrz{2.5}  \\
  \midrule
  Singleton  & 109  (100\%)    & 36 (33.0\%)  & 18 (16.5\%)  & 15 (13.7\%) & 12 (11.0\%) \\
  Recurrent  & 1836 (100\%)    & 383 (20.8\%) & 221 (12.0\%) & 134 (7.2\%) & 80 (4.3\%)  \\
  Total      & 1954 (100\%)    & 419 (21.4\%) & 239 (12.2\%) & 149 (7.6\%) & 92 (4.7\%)  \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabulary}
  \caption{A table showing the counts of rejected loops in each type of motif,
    singleton or recurrent. The percents in the parenthesis indicate the percent
    of rejected loops that occur in each type of motif relative to all loops in
    that type of motif. Thus the upper row shows that there 109 loops in
    singleton motifs and of those 36 or 33.0\% are rejected at \rsrz{1}, while
    at \rsrz{2.5} only 12 or 11\% are rejected.}
  \label{tab:loop-motif-fraction}
\end{table}

From here I explored whether singleton or motif families are altered more
frequently by RSR-Z cutoffs. Shown in Table~\ref{tab:number-motifs-altered} is
the summary of the number of motifs altered at each cutoff. From this table it
appears that the majority of motifs affected are recurrent motifs, 57\% of
recurrent motifs contain at least one loop that is rejected as compared to 33\%
percent of the singletons that contain a rejected loop. The difference between
this table, which shows that recurrent motifs are altered by RSR-Z criterion, as
compared to the previous one which shows that singleton instances are altered by
RSR-Z is due to the fact that there are many fewer loops that appear in a
singleton family, 109, as compared to recurrent motifs, 1685.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{lLRRRR}
    \toprule
          &                   & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Number Internal Loop Motifs Altered} \\
                                \cmidrule(r){3-6}
    Cutoff & Number of Motifs & Total & Singletons Lost & Recurrent Altered & Recurrent Lost \\
    \midrule
    \rsrz{1}   & 256 (100\%) & 120 (46\%) & 36 (14\%) & 84 (32\%) & \\
    \rsrz{1.5} & 256 (100\%) & 71 (27\%)  & 18 (7\%)  & 53 (20\%) & \\
    \rsrz{2}   & 256 (100\%) & 43 (17\%)  & 15 (5\%)  & 28 (10\%) & \\
    \rsrz{2.5} & 256 (100\%) & 34 (13\%)  & 12 (4\%)  & 22 (9\%)  & \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabulary}
  \caption{A table showing the number of motifs for singletons vs recurrent
    motifs with rejected loops for each cutoff tested here. The counts are the
    number of loops rejected by each cutoff while the percents in the
    parenthesis are the fraction of all motifs of that type that are are
    affected by the cutoff. The upper left column indicates that there are 120
    total motifs that contain rejected loops, and this is 46\% (120/256) of all
    motifs, while the column to the right indicates that 33\% (36/109) of all
  singleton motifs are rejected by the RSR-Z \textgreater 1 cutoff.}
  \label{tab:number-motifs-altered}
\end{table}

This analysis shows that the instances that are rejected are generally from
recurrent motifs. This is due to the fact that the majority of loops (1836 of
1954) are from recurrent motifs. When analyzed on a per instance basis however,
the instances targeted are from singleton motifs. 

\subsubsection{Are the loops altered distinct from other loops}

To test if the RSR-Z criteria effects singleton groups more than recurrent motifs
I created a table that shows the counts of loops in each class, singleton vs
recurrent motifs that are rejected as normalized by the total number of loops
shown in Table~\ref{tab:loop-motif-fraction}. This table shows that vast
majority of rejected loops, greater than 85\% for all cutoffs, occur in
recurrent motifs. From this I infer that the singleton motifs are generally
modeled correctly. However, the recurrent motifs  often contain poorly  modeled
loops. This is consistent with the hypothesis that poorly modeled loops occur
because a structure was used as a template and a loop was not modified to fit
the new data well.

To answer the second question I created a histogram of the minimum for excluded
loops to all other loops it's motif group show in
Figure~\ref{fig:exclude-min-disc}. From this figure we can see that the RSR-Z
cutoffs appear to reject outliers within groups as the distribution of
discrepancy values peaks near 0, indicating that there is always at least one
other loop that the outlier is similar to.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter-5/figs/motifs/discrepancy-to-kept}
  \caption{A histogram of the minimum discrepancy from a rejected loop to all
    other loops in the motif family. Lower values indicate a more similar pair
    of instances. Our motif atlas requires that all instances in the same motif
  family have discrepancy less than 1{\AA}/nt.}
  \label{fig:exclude-min-disc}
\end{figure}

This figure shows that the excluded loops are often similar to at least one
other member of their family. This indicates that our RSR-Z criteria is not
removing geometric outliers from each motif family.

The RSR-Z criteria appear to primarily exclude members of recurrent motifs that
are geometrically similar to other members of the motif family. RSR-Z criteria
have a much smaller effect than than other motifs, most notably the criteria to
not use any loops from cryo-em structures.

\section{Conclusions and future work}

Here I have described improvements to the previous loop selection criteria, as
well as implementation and tuning of a new method that uses a measure of X-ray
structure validation, RSR-Z, to identify loops that are supported by
experimental data. After investigating the effects of these new criteria on
clustering we see that the largest effect comes from rejecting loops from
cryo-em structures. Usage of RSR-Z does not appear to improve the homogeneity of
groups, as seen by examining the discrepancies of rejected loops.

Future work may focus on exploring other measures such as the number of
favorable and unfavorable interactions or even calculations of the potential or
even free entry. In addition, it is possible to calculate RSR-Z by parts of
nucleotides, base separate from backbone. Doing so could provide a more refined
measure of the modeling quality.
